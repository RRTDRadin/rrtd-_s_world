         Pet Tier List


    </h2>
    <p>Know which pets are best for each update. Mythical and Huge pets are top-tier and deal the most damage. Check online tier lists and focus on hatching the eggs that give you the strongest pets. Limited-time pets from events are often more valuable.

</p>

    <h2>
        Coin Multiplier Zones

    </h2>
    <p>Different areas give different rewards based on your pets. Always farm in zones where your pets get the highest coin multipliers. Some VIP zones or event areas offer better rates. Use your best pets in these areas for max efficiency.
</p>

    <h2>
         Enchanting Mastery



    </h2>
    <p>Use the enchanting machine to give your pets useful powers. The best enchants include Tech Coins V, Royalty, and Strength V. Don’t waste enchants on weak pets—only use them on strong ones you’ll keep.
</p>

    <h2>
        Trading Smartly

    </h2>
    <p>
Know the value of each pet before trading. Use Pet Sim value websites or Discord trading servers. Avoid trading your best pets too quickly, and always double-check trade offers. Scams are common.
</p>

    <h2>
      Fuse Strategy

    </h2>
    <p>Fusing pets can give you rare versions of higher-tier pets. Look up the best fuse recipes online. Combining 12 basic pets with a few higher rarity ones often gives you a great result.
</p>

    <h2>
       Daily Rewards and Boosts

    </h2>
    <p>Log in every day to collect daily gifts. Use boosts like triple coins, triple damage, or server boosts when farming bosses or during events. This helps you collect currency and pets faster.




</p>

    <h2>
        Hardcore Mode Tips

    </h2>
    <p>Hardcore mode is more challenging but offers better pets. Use high-enchant pets and grind in easier zones first. Don’t try to rush hardcore mode—move slowly and build a strong team.

</p>

    <h2>
        Merchant and Events

    </h2>
    <p>Merchants often sell powerful pets with enchants for diamonds. Event eggs are limited time and usually drop overpowered pets. Save diamonds and always participate in events for free rare pets.


</p>

    <h2>
       Inventory Management

    </h2>
    <p>Keep your pet inventory clean. Delete or fuse useless pets. Lock your most valuable pets so you don’t accidentally delete or trade them.
</p>

    <h2>
        Rank and Achievements

    </h2>
    <p>Completing achievements and ranking up gives you free rewards like boosts, diamonds, and exclusive pets. Focus on completing the easiest achievements first for fast progress.
