    <h1>
        Freefire
    </h1>
    <h2 >
        Controls and HUD
    </h2>
    <p>Your gameplay starts with how you control the game. Use a custom HUD that fits your hand and allows quick access to important buttons like fire, jump, crouch, and gloo wall. Many pros use a 3-finger or 4-finger claw setup. This setup helps you move, aim, and shoot at the same time, giving you a faster reaction in battles.</p>

    <h2>
        Sensitivity Settings and Headshots
    </h2>
    <p>Pro players land headshots consistently, and this comes from having perfect sensitivity settings. Adjust General, Red Dot, 2x, and 4x sensitivities until they feel right for your device. Once set, practice dragging your aim toward the enemy’s head in training ground or clash squad. Good aim = fast kills.</p>

    <h2>
        Weapon Mastery

    </h2>
    <p>Don’t try to use every weapon in the game. Instead, pick a few and master them. For close-range fights, use M1887 or MP40. For mid-range, try SCAR, XM8, or AN94. For long-range, go for Woodpecker or AWM. Learn each weapon’s recoil, range, and damage style so you can win every type of fight.</p>

    <h2>
        Gloo Wall and Movement
    </h2>
    <p>Gloo walls are one of the most important tools in Free Fire. Learn how to place them fast and correctly, especially while jumping or running. Combine gloo wall skills with smooth movement—like jumping, sliding, and crouching—to avoid getting hit and surprise your enemies.

</p>

    <h2>
       Map and Zone Awareness
    </h2>
    <p>Pro players don’t just land anywhere—they land smart. Learn the best drop locations, high-loot areas, and safe zones. Also, always keep an eye on the zone and plan your movement early. Rotating late or from the wrong direction can get you ambushed or killed by the zone.</p>

    <h2>
       Positioning and Cover
    </h2>
    <p>In Free Fire, the right position can decide whether you win or lose a fight. Stay near natural cover like rocks, trees, or buildings. Always try to take the high ground when possible—it gives better vision and shooting angles. Avoid standing in open areas without cover.

</p>

    <h2>
         Game Sense and Decision-Making
    </h2>
    <p>Game sense is your ability to understand what’s happening and make the right choices. Know when to push, when to hold, and when to retreat. Use sound cues, the map, and enemy movement to predict where they’ll go and how they’ll fight. Smart decisions win more games than just good aim.</p>

    <h2>
        Teamwork (For Squad Mode)
    </h2>
    <p>In squads, it’s not about who gets the most kills. It’s about communication and roles. Use voice chat, revive each other smartly, and don’t fight alone. Assign roles like rusher, sniper, or support so that each person knows what to do. A well-coordinated team beats any solo hero.</p>

    <h2>
        Practice Routine
    </h2>
    <p>Every pro has a daily training routine. Spend time in training ground for headshots and aim control. Play Clash Squad for fast-paced action and movement practice. Switch to Battle Royale to work on zone control and survival. Even 1–2 hours of smart practice a day makes a big difference.</p>

    <h2>
        Tournaments and Custom Rooms
    </h2>
    <p>Once you’re confident, step into the competitive scene. Play custom rooms with friends or online players to test your skills in real fights. Join small Free Fire tournaments (many are free to enter). This is where you’ll learn to play under pressure and grow as a real competitor.</p>
