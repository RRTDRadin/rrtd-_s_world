        Fruit Knowledge and Tier List
    </h2>
    <p>Know the best fruits for grinding, PvP, and raids. Fruits like Leopard, Dough, Dragon, and Buddha are top-tier. Study the tier list and always aim for a powerful fruit to boost your advantage in battles and farming.
</p>

    <h2>
        Mastering Combos
    </h2>
    <p>Pro players use skill combos with fruits, swords, and fighting styles to destroy enemies before they can react. Practice timing, range, and knockback effects to chain hits together without letting the opponent escape.</p>

    <h2>
         Leveling Up Fast

    </h2>
    <p>Grind with smart strategy—focus on quests, NPC farming, and boss fights for faster XP. Use logia fruits (like Light or Flame) for immunity against lower-level enemies and grind in the safest, fastest way.

</p>

    <h2>
        Awakening Fruits
    </h2>
    <p>
        Once you reach higher levels, awaken your fruit for extra power. Join Raids, collect fragments, and fully awaken each move. An awakened fruit can massively boost your damage and effectiveness in PvE and PvP.
</p>

    <h2>
      Sword and Fighting Style Mastery
    </h2>
    <p>Fruits are strong, but a real pro also levels up swords and fighting styles like Electric Claw or Dragon Talon. This gives you more tools in battle and allows you to combo mix with insane damage.</p>

    <h2>
       PvP Techniques
    </h2>
    <p>Use observation haki, dodging, air jumps, and timing to win PvP fights. Learn how to bait enemy attacks and punish them with combos. Always keep distance unless your combo starts close-range.



</p>

    <h2>
        Boss and Raid Strategies
    </h2>
    <p>Every boss has a unique pattern. Learn how to dodge, when to block, and how to use terrain for cover. During raids, teamwork and DPS balance are key. Assign fruit users and support to win with minimal deaths.

</p>

    <h2>
        Sea Navigation and Islands
    </h2>
    <p>Get familiar with the map—know which islands are for your level, where raids spawn, and how to travel quickly. Owning a fast boat or using portal abilities makes a big difference in time efficiency.

</p>

    <h2>
       Haki Progression
    </h2>
    <p>Level up your Buso Haki (Armament), Observation Haki, and Conqueror’s Haki if you have it. These unlock stronger defense, damage, and dodging skills—essential for endgame fights and PvP.</p>

    <h2>
        Trading and Economy
    </h2>
    <p>Learn the value of fruits in trading. A pro player knows when to store, trade, or use a fruit based on market value. Trading smartly can help you collect rare fruits or unlock abilities you don’t have yet.
