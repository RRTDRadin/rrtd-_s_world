        Controls and Layout
    </h2>
    <p>PUBG Mobile offers a lot of control customization. Set up a custom layout that fits your playstyle. Most pros use a 4-finger claw setup for better multitasking—like moving, aiming, and shooting at the same time. Make sure your fire, aim, crouch, prone, and jump buttons are all comfortably reachable.</p>

    <h2>
         Sensitivity Settings and Aim
    </h2>
    <p>Great aim separates casual players from pros. Fine-tune your camera, ADS, and gyroscope sensitivity for better aim tracking and recoil control. Use the training ground to practice moving targets, aim tracking, and especially controlling spray recoil at different distances.</p>

    <h2>
        Gun Mastery and Loadout

    </h2>
    <p>Understand the best guns for each situation and get comfortable with them. Learn the spray patterns of ARs like M416, AKM, and SCAR-L. Master snipers like Kar98k or M24 for long-distance shots. Know which attachments improve recoil and reload speed. Stick with your favorite loadout and sharpen your reflexes.

</p>

    <h2>
        Recoil Control and Gyroscope
    </h2>
    <p>
        Using the gyroscope gives you a big advantage for recoil control, especially in full-auto firing. Practice combining finger drag and gyro tilting to hold your aim steady while spraying. M416 with a compensator and vertical grip is perfect for learning this skill.

</p>

    <h2>
       Map Knowledge and Drop Strategy
    </h2>
    <p>Each map (Erangel, Miramar, Livik, etc.) has its own hot drops, loot zones, and rotation routes. Learn where to land for early fights or safe loot. Understanding the geography helps you rotate smartly, use terrain for cover, and avoid getting caught in bad zones.</p>

    <h2>
       Zone and Circle Control
    </h2>
    <p>Stay ahead of the blue zone. Predict the safe zone early and rotate before enemies get there. Always aim to take high ground or central positions for better vision and safety. Knowing where to move and when is key to getting to the final circle safely.

</p>

    <h2>
        Positioning and Cover
    </h2>
    <p>Avoid open areas and always fight from behind cover—trees, rocks, buildings, ridges. Positioning wins gunfights. Try to flank enemies, stay in higher elevation, and control angles. Learn how to peek using the “lean” buttons to surprise enemies without exposing your whole body.

</p>

    <h2>
        Game Sense and Decision-Making
    </h2>
    <p>Game sense is about reading the situation and reacting wisely. Know when to push, when to heal, when to rotate. If you hear gunshots, decide if it’s safe to engage. Observe kill feed, enemy footsteps, and zone shifts. Over time, this instinct becomes second nature.</p>

    <h2>
       Team Coordination (for Squads)
    </h2>
    <p>A pro squad works together like a unit. Communicate constantly—call enemy positions, request backup, and plan your moves together. Stick to your role (rusher, sniper, support) and don’t go solo unless needed. Proper reviving, looting, and backing up makes your team unstoppable.</p>

    <h2>
        Competitive Play and Practice Routine
    </h2>
    <p>Join custom rooms and scrims to test your skills against real opponents. Play TDM (Team Deathmatch) and Arena for aim practice. Regularly grind ranked classic matches to improve game awareness. Watching pro tournaments like PMGC or PMPL also teaches strategies and rotations used by top teams.</p>
