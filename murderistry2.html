        Role Strategy

    </h2>
    <p>Master each role. As an Innocent, play smart and avoid obvious paths. As the Sheriff, stay focused and be ready to shoot with precision. As the Murderer, hide your role until the perfect moment to strike and control the game by eliminating key players quickly.

</p>

    <h2>
        Map Knowledge

    </h2>
    <p>Learn every map’s layout, including hiding spots, secret vents, and escape routes. This helps you stay alive longer, flank opponents, or surprise them depending on your role.</p>

    <h2>
         Weapon Control

    </h2>
    <p>Murderers should practice knife throws and quick attacks. Sheriffs must train to aim calmly under pressure. Precision and timing are key to winning shootouts or clutch rounds.


</p>

    <h2>
        Hiding and Movement
    </h2>
    <p>
        Use hiding spots wisely. Jump, crouch, and move unpredictably to avoid being hit. Learn when to move fast and when to stay hidden based on who’s chasing or observing you.
</p>

    <h2>
      Clue and Behavior Reading
    </h2>
    <p>Pay attention to how others act. Are they following you too closely? Running without reason? These behaviors can help you identify the murderer or mislead others when you’re playing the killer.
</p>

    <h2>
       Coin Collection



    </h2>
    <p>Even while playing smart, collect coins during each round. These let you open crates and unlock rare knives and guns for your collection.



</p>

    <h2>
        Skin Economy
    </h2>
    <p>Trade wisely by using the MM2 value list. Aim for limited-edition knives and guns during events. Protect your most valuable items with trade locks and know how to spot scam tactics.


</p>

    <h2>
    Practice and Spectate

    </h2>
    <p>When eliminated, watch others to learn better strategies. See how pros move, aim, and trick others—it’s a great way to improve your own gameplay.

</p>

    <h2>
       Team Interaction
    </h2>
    <p>Use social awareness to build trust or manipulate suspicion. In Innocent teams, share info. As Murderer, use the crowd to blend in and hide your actions until it’s too late.
</p>

    <h2>
        Custom Looks
    </h2>
    <p>Your avatar’s look can affect how others see you. Use clean, distraction-free outfits in serious games or go all-out with flashy skins during fun matches.
