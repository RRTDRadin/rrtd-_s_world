        Aim Practice
    </h2>
    <p>Arsenal is a shooter—so aim is everything. Use flick shots and tracking to hit heads. Train daily in public matches or use aim trainers inside Roblox if available.



</p>

    <h2>
        Weapon Familiarity
    </h2>
    <p>You get a different weapon with each kill. Learn how to use every weapon efficiently—shotguns, snipers, rocket launchers, and even the golden knife. Every weapon has a trick to it.</p>

    <h2>
         Movement and Positioning

    </h2>
    <p>Strafe, jump, and move unpredictably to dodge bullets. Use the map’s design—ramps, corners, and rooftops—to get better angles and surprise opponents.



</p>

    <h2>
       Game Sense
    </h2>
    <p>
       Know where enemies spawn, where they rotate, and how to predict their movement. A good player can flank and pick off multiple opponents before being seen.
</p>

    <h2>
      Fast Weapon Switching
    </h2>
    <p>Be ready to adapt quickly as your weapon changes. Don’t panic if you get a sniper in close range—learn how to quickscope or jump-shot with it under pressure.</p>

    <h2>
       Map Knowledge
    </h2>
    <p>Know the ins and outs of every map. Use this to take shortcuts, escape death, or flank around enemies. Map control = kill advantage.


</p>

    <h2>
        Health Pack Control
    </h2>
    <p>After a kill, health packs drop. Picking them up during fights gives you survival chances. A real pro uses these to win 2v1s or stay in the fight longer.

</p>

    <h2>
        Sound Awareness
    </h2>
    <p>Listen for footsteps, gunfire, and respawn sounds. Sound can alert you to enemy locations even before you see them.

</p>

    <h2>
       Killstreak Management
    </h2>
    <p>Play smart when you're on a streak. Avoid risky duels, move carefully, and build up to the golden knife smoothly. One mistake can lose your entire lead.</p>

    <h2>
        Competitive Mode and Events
    </h2>
    <p>Join competitive servers and events to challenge skilled players. These high-pressure matches help you improve faster and expose your weaknesses so you can improve them.
