        Obby Practice

    </h2>
    <p>Mastering obstacle courses is the foundation of Tower of Hell. Start with easier towers and practice common movements such as ladder jumps, wall hops, wraparounds, and corner clips. Each level tests precision and timing. As you get better, aim for smoother and faster runs without pauses.


</p>

    <h2>
         Shift Lock and Zoom


    </h2>
    <p>Use shift lock or first-person view to gain better alignment during tricky jumps. These tools improve your control, especially on narrow platforms and edge jumps. Adjust your camera angles before jumping to make sure you’re facing the right direction.</p>

    <h2>
         Stage Memory


    </h2>
    <p>Each tower is randomly built from dozens of preset stages. Learn the stages by name and style—many appear frequently. Knowing the timing, jump lengths, and patterns of each makes them easier to beat.


</p>

    <h2>
        Shortcut Mastery

    </h2>
    <p>
        Pros often use shortcuts that skip entire sections of a stage. These are risky but save time. Watch YouTube tutorials or observe other players to learn advanced jump angles and clutch landing points.

</p>

    <h2>
       Momentum Control

    </h2>
    <p>Don’t just jump blindly—understand how your movement momentum affects each jump. For example, long jumps need speed, while short ones require tighter control. Adjust how far or fast you move between platforms.
</p>

    <h2>
       Practice Towers

    </h2>
    <p>Use VIP servers or join quiet public servers to practice hard stages without distractions. Focus on stages where you commonly fall and master them before pushing for wins.




</p>

    <h2>
        Gear Use
    </h2>
    <p>In private servers, test gear like gravity coils and invincibility. They’re banned in competitive runs but great for casual practice. They help you explore paths and mechanics without the fear of falling.
</p>

    <h2>
        Timer Awareness

    </h2>
    <p>Once someone finishes the tower, the countdown timer speeds up. Keep an eye on the timer and make strategic decisions—either rush to the top or wait for the next round to avoid stress.


</p>

    <h2>
       Race Strategy

    </h2>
    <p>In races, you need both speed and consistency. Avoid flashy moves that might cost you time. Instead, master each section and move fluidly. Consistency always wins over risky jumps.
</p>

    <h2>
        Stage Prediction

    </h2>
    <p>If you’re behind, watch other players ahead of you to see how they complete a stage. This gives you insight on what’s coming and how to approach it, especially in unknown or new towers.
