        Role Selection



    </h2>
    <p>The foundation of great roleplay is a unique character. Create detailed personas like an undercover agent, rogue hacker, runaway teen, or ghost hunter. Give your character a name, goal, and personality. The more real your role feels, the more people will engage with you.

</p>

    </h2>House Setup</h2>
    <p>Choose your home wisely. Every Brookhaven house has different layouts and secrets—some have bunkers, security cams, or hidden passages. A spy might use a tech base, a family might need a cozy neighborhood home. Use decor and furniture to set up your scene.
</p>

    <h2>
         Vehicle Use

    </h2>
    <p>Practice building structures from basic houses to mega bases. Learn how to use block palettes, depth, and symmetry. Watch building tutorials or replicate famous builds to improve. Using scaffolding and building tools like WorldEdit (in Creative or servers) helps too.


</p>

    <h2>
        Props and Items
    </h2>
    <p>
        Brookhaven gives access to lots of roleplay items like cameras, laptops, money bags, food, and weapons. Use these to act out your story visually. For example, a thief might carry a crowbar while sneaking around a mansion at night.

</p>

    <h2>
      Secret Locations

    </h2>
    <p>Explore hidden areas like the agency base, mountain lab, or haunted house. These secret spots add excitement and mystery to your roleplays. Use them for planning hideouts, secret meetings, or dramatic reveals in your story.
</p>

    <h2>
       Roleplay Teams
    </h2>
    <p>The most fun roleplays are with groups. Join or create teams—families, gangs, special ops units, schools, hospitals. Assign everyone a role and create ongoing stories together. Consistent teams attract others and grow your audience if you're recording.




</p>

    <h2>
        Outfit Matching
    </h2>
    <p>Your outfit sets the tone. Use Brookhaven’s avatar editor to dress exactly like your role. Change your outfit mid-roleplay if your story changes—for example, switching from a firefighter to a disguised spy. Props + outfits = powerful immersion.


</p>

    <h2>
        Chat and Interaction

    </h2>
    <p>Type actions in chat using asterisks or roleplay markers like:
*types on laptop quickly*
*draws weapon and whispers into radio*
Emotes and well-written text bring your character to life. Use /e commands to dance, wave, or sit for added realism.


</p>

    <h2>
       Scene Creation
    </h2>
    <p>Don’t just roleplay randomly—create episodes. Plan out a storyline: a school mystery, an alien abduction, a city-wide blackout, or a secret crime ring. Use environment tools and settings to change the mood and enhance your roleplay.
</p>

    <h2>
        Recording and Sharing
    </h2>
    <p>If you love roleplaying, record your episodes. Use screen recorders or Roblox’s built-in features, add voiceovers or captions, and edit short clips for TikTok or long-form videos for YouTube. This builds your following and improves your storytelling skills.
