        Stumble Guys
    </h1>
    <h2 >
        Controls and Movement
    </h2>
    <p>Mastering movement is the foundation of skill in Stumble Guys. Get used to jumping, diving (slide mid-air), and changing direction quickly. Learn how to chain jumps and dives to cross gaps, avoid obstacles, and speed up your movement. Precision and timing are everything.</p>

    <h2>
          Map Knowledge
    </h2>
    <p>Each map has its own shortcuts, traps, and strategies. Learn all maps (like Block Dash, Lava Land, Lost Temple, Bombardment) by heart. Know where to take safe routes, when to take risky shortcuts, and which paths most players avoid. Map knowledge is a huge advantage in close rounds.</p>

    <h2>
       Obstacle Timing

    </h2>
    <p>Every obstacle—spinning hammers, lasers, rotating logs—has a pattern. Watch carefully and time your movement to pass them without getting knocked off. Patience beats rushing. Pros wait a split second if it means surviving and qualifying.


</p>

    <h2>
        Dive Mastery
    </h2>
    <p>
       The dive move is more than just a jump extender—it helps you cross wider gaps, pass under low barriers, and knock back other players. Practice dive-jumping through narrow platforms or right before falling to clutch survival. Dive control is a pro-level skill.



</p>

    <h2>
       Griefing and Defense
    </h2>
    <p>Some maps allow grabbing, punching, or emoting to knock others off. Know how to defend yourself and how to use these moves when needed. Don’t overdo it, but in final rounds, pushing someone at the right time can be the difference between winning and losing.

</p>

    <h2>
       Eliminator Map Strategy
    </h2>
    <p>Maps like Laser Tracer, Lava Land, and Bombardment are survival maps. Here, focus on staying alive, not rushing. Stay away from crowds, read patterns, and keep your camera angle wide to see all threats. The longer you survive, the fewer players you’ll need to compete against at the end.

</p>

    <h2>
       Camera Control

    </h2>
    <p>Control your camera to see obstacles and players better. Always position it in a way that gives you full visibility of the next challenge. On spinning maps or eliminators, good camera control helps you react faster and avoid surprises.
</p>

    <h2>
        Mental Focus and Patience
    </h2>
    <p>Many players lose because they panic or rush. Stay calm, especially on maps with moving platforms or rising lava. Slow, calculated moves often win over speed. Stay focused and don’t let other players distract you.</p>

    <h2>
       Practice and Custom Games
    </h2>
    <p>The best way to improve is by playing a lot—and smartly. Use custom rooms or solo lobbies to practice tough maps. Replay maps where you struggle and focus on mastering their toughest parts until you no longer make mistakes.

</p>

    <h2>
        Tournaments, Events, and Skins
    </h2>
    <p>Join events and official tournaments to test your skills against top players. While skins and emotes don’t give power, some emotes like punch, hug, or kick can be used strategically in gameplay. Unlock and use them wisely if you want a competitive edge.</p>
