        Drop Spot Strategy
    </h2>
    <p>Master the map by choosing drop locations that match your playstyle. Hot drops like Tilted Towers are great for fast action and practicing fights, while remote spots offer time to loot and plan. Knowing chest spawns, rotation paths, and storm patterns gives you a major advantage.

</p>

    <h2>
        Building and Editing    
    </h2>
    <p>Building is what makes Fortnite unique. To be a pro, you must build defensively (like walls, ramps, and boxes) and offensively (like high-ground retakes and 90s). Fast edits (windows, doors, and corners) help you outplay opponents in close fights and escape tight spots.</p>

    <h2>
        Aim Training

    </h2>
    <p>Work on your aim with different weapon types—shotguns for close combat, ARs for mid-range, and snipers for long shots. Use aim trainers like Aim Lab (on PC) or practice in Creative mode to boost your precision and reflexes.

</p>

    <h2>
        Inventory Management
    </h2>
    <p>
        Carry a balanced loadout: a shotgun, an AR or SMG, healing items, and mobility (like Shockwave Grenades or Launch Pads). Know which weapon types suit your skill level and adjust based on your enemies and the zone.
</p>

    <h2>
      Storm Awareness
    </h2>
    <p>Track the storm and rotate early to avoid late-game panic. Stay on the safe side of the circle, use natural cover, and plan rotations using vehicles or builds. Advanced players use storm edges to surprise others who are rotating slowly.</p>

    <h2>
       Edit Courses and Creative Mode
    </h2>
    <p>Spend time in Creative practicing builds and edit courses. Pro players grind hours on “free build maps” to improve muscle memory. These private maps let you warm up without pressure before real matches.



</p>

    <h2>
        Piece Control
    </h2>
    <p>Piece control means placing builds before your opponent does in a fight. It’s a pro technique where you trap them in your box and edit faster than they can react. Learn wall-replace tricks and cone edits to master it.

</p>

    <h2>
        Game Sense and Positioning

    </h2>
    <p>You don’t need to build all the time. Sometimes, smart positioning, listening to footsteps, and holding angles wins fights without wasting materials. Use high ground, bush cover, and storm edge pressure to control fights.

</p>

    <h2>
       Competitive Mode and Arena
    </h2>
    <p>Test your skills in Arena mode, where you face tougher opponents and earn Hype. Climbing Arena divisions teaches you smarter playstyles and prepares you for tournaments like Cash Cups or FNCS.</p>

    <h2>
        Custom Settings and HUD
    </h2>
    <p>Customize your controls, sensitivity, and HUD layout for your comfort. Pro players optimize their settings for faster edits, smoother aim, and better awareness. Use Builder Pro or custom keybinds to boost your speed.
