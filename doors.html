         Room Awareness
    </h2>
    <p>Pay attention to the numbers above each door to avoid getting lost or backtracking. Certain entities like Rush, Ambush, and Seek often spawn after specific rooms (e.g., Rush after Room 10+). Knowing where you are in the run helps you mentally prepare for the next danger and avoid opening the wrong door during chase scenes.

</p>

    <h2>
        Sound Cues
    </h2>
    <p>Enemies give off distinct sounds before they appear. Rush makes a distant roaring noise, Ambush has a repeated screeching sound, and Screech whispers “psst.” Using headphones allows you to hear these better and react fast. Most pro players rely on these audio clues to know when to hide or spin around.</p>

    <h2>
         Hiding Timing
    </h2>
    <p>Hide from Rush or Ambush at the perfect moment. Hiding too early will force you to leave and possibly die. Wait until you hear the enemy getting close, then jump into a closet or under a bed. Ambush comes back multiple times, so exit and re-enter hiding accordingly.

</p>

    <h2>
        Screech Survival
    </h2>
    <p>
        Screech appears in dark rooms. When you hear “psst,” look in all directions until you find it and stare at it. Carrying a flashlight or lighter reduces the chance it will spawn. If you ignore Screech too long, it will jump-scare you and deal damage.
</p>

    <h2>
       Light Flicker Reading


    </h2>
    <p>Lights flickering mean something is coming—usually Rush or Ambush. But sometimes it can be false alarms. Learning the difference between a flicker caused by an entity and one caused by Seek's chase is important to avoid hiding too soon or missing a hiding spot.</p>

    <h2>
       Seek and Halt Paths


    </h2>
    <p>Seek's chase is all about quick reactions. Know how to dodge hands, slide under tables, and pick the correct doors (usually the one without glowing eyes). Halt requires memorizing its pattern of turning back and forth to avoid damage while walking.



</p>

    <h2>
        Key and Lever Finding


    </h2>
    <p>Keys and levers are often hidden in drawers, shelves, or side rooms. They emit a faint sparkling sound when nearby. Instead of searching randomly, listen closely and check obvious spawn spots like desks and bookshelves.

</p>

    <h2>
        Item Usage


    </h2>
    <p>Always keep items like lockpicks, vitamins, and a lighter or flashlight. Lockpicks can skip annoying puzzles, vitamins help during chase scenes, and light sources are essential in dark rooms.

</p>

    <h2>
       Team Play (Multiplayer)


    </h2>
    <p>If you're playing with friends, coordinate who searches which areas and avoid fighting over closets. Use teamwork to find keys and share item pickups to help everyone survive longer.</p>

    <h2>
        Endgame Strategy (Room 90+)


    </h2>
    <p>The last 10 rooms are filled with traps, frequent dark areas, and tougher enemies. Move slowly, don’t run blindly, and save your best items for these rooms. Know how to solve the elevator puzzle quickly to escape.
