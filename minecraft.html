    <h1>
        Minecraft
    </h1>
    <h2 >
        Controls and Keybinds
    </h2>
    <p>Start by setting up a custom control scheme that fits your hand speed and playstyle. Adjust your sprint, sneak, and hotbar keys so you can switch tools, fight, or build without thinking. Using shortcuts efficiently gives you an edge, especially in PvP or speedrunning.

</p>

    <h2>
        Game Modes and Mechanics Mastery
    </h2>
    <p>Understand the differences between Survival, Creative, Hardcore, Adventure, and Spectator modes. Each mode changes the way you interact with the world. Learn Minecraft’s core mechanics—crafting, smelting, redstone, enchanting, and how mobs behave.</p>

    <h2>
         Building and Architecture

    </h2>
    <p>Practice building structures from basic houses to mega bases. Learn how to use block palettes, depth, and symmetry. Watch building tutorials or replicate famous builds to improve. Using scaffolding and building tools like WorldEdit (in Creative or servers) helps too.

</p>

    <h2>
        Survival Skills and Early Game
    </h2>
    <p>
        Know how to survive the first night, gather essential tools quickly, and find food sources. Learn the early progression path: wood → stone → iron → diamond → netherite. Explore caves, villages, and mineshafts efficiently while avoiding fall damage and mobs.
</p>

    <h2>
      Redstone Engineering
    </h2>
    <p>Master redstone basics like power sources, repeaters, comparators, pistons, and observers. Then move on to advanced builds like automatic farms, hidden doors, elevators, and sorting systems. Redstone skills turn you from a regular player into a Minecraft engineer.</p>

    <h2>
       Combat and PvP
    </h2>
    <p>Get good with sword, axe, bow, and crossbow combat. Practice crit hits, shield timing, and movement. In PvP servers, practice in duels and minigames like Bed Wars or UHC. Learn potion use and gear enchantments for combat advantages.



</p>

    <h2>
        Enchanting and Gear Optimization
    </h2>
    <p>Set up an enchantment station early in survival. Learn the best enchantments for each tool and weapon (e.g., Efficiency V, Sharpness V, Mending, Protection IV). Combine items wisely on anvils and always carry backup gear for long explorations or boss fights.

</p>

    <h2>
        Exploration and Navigation
    </h2>
    <p>Know how to travel the world efficiently. Use coordinates (F3) to navigate, build nether portals for fast travel, and use maps and compasses. Learn how to explore and loot structures like bastions, temples, strongholds, and ancient cities safely.

</p>

    <h2>
       Boss Fights and Advanced Progression
    </h2>
    <p>Fight the Ender Dragon, Wither, and explore Ancient Cities with confidence. Prepare strong gear, plenty of food, and potions. Learn strategies for placing beds in the End, summoning the Wither underground, or navigating deep dark biomes without triggering the Warden.</p>

    <h2>
        Multiplayer, Servers, and Minigames
    </h2>
    <p>Join servers to explore multiplayer gameplay. Play Skyblock, Bed Wars, Survival SMP, or creative plots. Use chat, commands, and plugins responsibly. Teamwork, community builds, and PvP battles in servers help you grow socially and competitively.
