        Nexbot Awareness

    </h2>
    <p>Each Nexbot behaves differently. Some bots like “Obunga” are fast and track you directly, while others like “Sanic” are loud and chaotic. Knowing the movement style and speed of each bot helps you decide whether to outrun, juke, or bait them away.

</p>

    <h2>
        Sound Tracking
    </h2>
    <p>Sound is your first warning. Bots get louder as they get closer. Use stereo headphones so you can tell if they’re coming from behind, the side, or ahead. You’ll react quicker and avoid surprise attacks in tight corridors.
</p>

    <h2>
         Camera Angle

    </h2>
    <p>Control your camera constantly. Look behind while running forward, and always keep your view open when entering new rooms or tight spaces. Good camera control lets you predict chases, spot downed allies, and plan escape routes.


</p>

    <h2>
        Sliding and Sprinting
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sprinting is limited—use it wisely during straightaways or final escapes. Combine it with sliding to juke around bots or get out of corners quickly. Master slide timing around tight bends for better control and momentum.

</p>

    <h2>
      Map Knowledge
    </h2>
    <p>Every map has its own safe zones, hiding spots, spawn traps, and vent routes. Learn where you can run safely or hide temporarily. Good players use maps like Backrooms, Mall, or Complex to bait bots through loops and obstacles.
</p>

    <h2>
       Reviving Strategy
    </h2>
    <p>Reviving teammates gives points but is risky. Wait for the bot to pass or get baited away before attempting a revive. Use crouch movement to stay hidden and revive faster without drawing attention.




</p>

    <h2>
        Game Modes
    </h2>

    <p>
        Classic mode is just survival, but others (like Limited Lives or No Sprinting) require smart team play. Adapt your approach—revive more often, stay close to teammates, and focus on survival over exploring.
</p>

    <h2>
         Team Support
    </h2>
    <p>Stick with the group. Teams that move together revive more, distract bots better, and survive longer. If someone is downed, rotate roles—one player distracts the bot while the other revives.


</p>

    <h2>
    Point Farming

    </h2>
    <p>Earn points by surviving long rounds, reviving teammates, and completing objectives. Don’t just hide—assist teammates and take risks for better rewards. Use XP boosts if available during events.</p>

    <h2>
       Cosmetic Strategy
    </h2>
    <p>Skins and emotes are fun, but choose ones that don’t block your view. Avoid tall hats or flashy effects that can make it hard to see in tight rooms. Sleek, simple skins help you stay alert and mobile.
